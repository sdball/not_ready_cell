# NotReadyCell

This is not a real smart cell. But it is a **working** smart cell. I claim it's essentially the most minimial smart cell you can write. Tests included!

## Installation

This is a demo project and not published to hex.pm. You can install it with a `git` declaration.

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:not_ready_cell, git: "https://github.com/sdball/not_ready_cell.git"}
  ]
end
```
