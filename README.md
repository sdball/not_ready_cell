# NotReadyCell

This is not a real smart cell. But it is a **working** smart cell. I claim it's essentially the most minimial smart cell you can write. Tests included!

This repo is paired with a blog post describing how and why it was written: https://www.rakeroutes.com/2022/05/18/let-s-write-an-elixir-livebook-smart-cell
